Drafts on the P vs. NP problem

For a good introduction to the P vs. NP problem, please see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQsdygaYcE4

We conjecture and argue for the following resolution to the P vs. NP problem: that it is unprovable within constructive mathematics that P != NP, but that sufficiently good heuristics can be found in most cases of interest for powerful AI systems to solve any problem in NP given enough ingenuity applied to the algorithm design and training process.

We trust that the significance of this claim is clear, but in case it is not, we spell it out. The current boom in artificial intelligence can be expected to scale to solve any problem whose solution can be efficiently checked. There are no limits to what AI can achieve, for good or for ill. We make a plea for peaceful use of the technology that is currently changing the world under our feet.
